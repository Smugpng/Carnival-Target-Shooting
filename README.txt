The object pool pattern is implemented by having four bullets that are placed out of view of the camera. Whenever the player fires, one of the bullets is moved into the scene right above the player and has their Bullet component enabled which sets their velocity and has code to handle collision with a target, as well as if the bullet goes off screen without colliding. If either of these happen, the bullet is moved back to its original position off screen and the Bullet component is disabled.

The builder pattern is implemented by the EnemyBuilder script which has a variety of values that it combines to make the enemy configuration. A blank enemy prefab is taken and a random option is generated from the four value enums for speed, size, points awarded, and row level. These values are assigned to the enemy and then the enemy is instantiated into the level, making each new target unique.

The observer pattern is implemented in the EnemyPoint script. There is an onDeathEvent that watches for when a target is destroyed. When the event is called it adds the points that the target was worth to the player's score and calls for the EnemyBuilder to make a new target to take its place.
